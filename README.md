## Project Goals
- [ ] Create a simplified game board
- [ ] Create a simple simulation environment that can play the game
  - [ ] Manually
  - [ ] With a provided "play" ruleset
- [ ] Evaluate performance of basic ruleset
- [ ] Test and explore optimal strategies

## Background
### Code implementations
[Full board game implementation in java](https://github.com/S0NN1/ing-sw-2020-piemonti-pirovano-sonnino)

[Reinforcement learning](https://github.com/pranavsb/santorini-RL) - broken code

[Python bot](https://github.com/tjl0005/Santorini-Boardgame) - broken imports

[UI for santorini](https://fostersamuel.github.io/fira/) - could be a good starting point, but it's all in typescript
